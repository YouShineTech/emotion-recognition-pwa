# Testing Guidelines for QA Test Documentation

## Test Case Creation Standards

### Test Case Identification

- **TC-ID Format**: TC-XXX (e.g., TC-001, TC-002)
- **Requirement Traceability**: Each test case must reference specific REQ-ID from requirements specification
- **Unique Identifiers**: No duplicate TC-IDs across all test categories

### Test Case Structure Requirements

#### Mandatory Fields

1. **TC-ID**: Unique test case identifier
2. **Requirement-ID**: Source requirement reference (REQ-XXX)
3. **Test-Objective**: Clear, concise purpose statement
4. **Priority**: P0 (Critical), P1 (High), P2 (Medium), P3 (Low)
5. **Test-Type**: Functional, Performance, Security, Integration, Boundary, UAT
6. **Preconditions**: Setup requirements and prerequisite test cases
7. **Step-Number**: Sequential step identifier (1, 2, 3, etc.)
8. **Action**: User/system action to perform
9. **Expected-Result**: Expected system response
10. **Pass-Criteria**: Success validation criteria
11. **Fail-Criteria**: Failure conditions
12. **Postconditions**: Cleanup actions and dependent tests enabled

#### Optional Fields

- **Notes**: Additional information, browser requirements, special considerations

### Test Step Guidelines

#### Action Requirements

- Use action-based language from user/system perspective
- Be specific and measurable
- Include exact UI elements to interact with
- Specify input values and parameters

#### Expected Result Requirements

- Describe observable system behavior
- Include specific UI changes or responses
- Specify timing requirements where applicable
- Define measurable outcomes

#### Pass/Fail Criteria

- **Pass Criteria**: Specific conditions that indicate success
- **Fail Criteria**: Specific conditions that indicate failure
- Both must be objective and measurable

### Preconditions and Postconditions

#### Preconditions Format

- List system state requirements
- Reference prerequisite test cases (e.g., "TC-000 passed")
- Specify required browser/device capabilities
- Define necessary permissions or configurations

#### Postconditions Format

- Describe system state after test completion
- List dependent test cases enabled (e.g., "Enables TC-002, TC-003")
- Specify cleanup actions required
- Note any persistent changes

## Test Categories and Coverage

### System Tests (Requirements-Based)

- **Source**: REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md
- **Focus**: Functional validation of documented requirements
- **Coverage**: 100% of requirements with positive and negative scenarios

### Integration Tests (Design-Based)

- **Source**: DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Focus**: Module interactions and system integration points
- **Coverage**: All documented interfaces and data flows

### Boundary Tests (Coverage Criteria)

- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Valid/invalid input classes
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Min/max/just-outside boundaries
- **Negative Testing**: Error conditions and constraint violations

### Acceptance Tests (Business Rules)

- **Source**: BUSINESS_RULES.md and user workflows
- **Focus**: End-to-end user scenarios and business validation
- **Coverage**: All documented user stories and business rules

## Test Execution Standards

### Independent Execution Requirements

- Test cases must be executable without source code access
- All necessary information included in test case documentation
- Clear, unambiguous steps that any tester can follow
- No assumptions about tester's technical knowledge

### Test Data and Environment

- Specify required test data in preconditions
- Define browser and device requirements
- Include network and performance requirements
- Provide sample inputs for boundary testing

### Result Documentation

- Record actual results for each step
- Document any deviations from expected results
- Link defects to specific test steps
- Note execution environment details

## Traceability Requirements

### Requirement Mapping

- Every test case must trace to at least one requirement
- Use specific REQ-IDs from requirements specification
- Maintain bidirectional traceability (requirement to test, test to requirement)

### Coverage Validation

- Ensure 100% requirements coverage
- Validate positive and negative scenario coverage
- Confirm boundary value and equivalence partitioning coverage
- Verify integration and interface coverage

### Gap Analysis

- Identify requirements without test coverage
- Flag test cases without requirement traceability
- Report missing coverage types (positive/negative/boundary)
- Validate business rule coverage

## Quality Assurance

### Test Case Review Criteria

- All mandatory fields completed
- Clear, actionable test steps
- Measurable pass/fail criteria
- Proper requirement traceability
- Independent execution capability

### Maintenance Procedures

- Regular synchronization with documentation updates
- Impact analysis when requirements change
- Test case versioning and change tracking
- Periodic coverage gap analysis

## Tools and Formats

### CSV Format Requirements

- Use standard CSV format for spreadsheet compatibility
- Include header row with field names
- Escape commas and quotes in field values
- Maintain consistent field ordering

### Spreadsheet Integration

- Import CSV files into Excel/Google Sheets for execution tracking
- Use formulas for pass/fail counting and coverage metrics
- Create pivot tables for analysis and reporting
- Maintain execution history and trend analysis
