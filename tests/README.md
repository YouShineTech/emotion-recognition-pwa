## Traceability and Coverage

### Requirements Traceability Matrix

- **File**: matrices/requirements-traceability.csv
- **Purpose**: Bidirectional mapping between requirements and test cases
- **Content**: REQ-ID to TC-ID relationships with coverage type tracking

### Coverage Matrix

- **File**: matrices/coverage-matrix.csv
- **Purpose**: Track coverage completeness across all test categories
- **Metrics**: Coverage percentages, test case counts, gap analysis

### Test Execution Matrix

- **File**: matrices/test-execution-matrix.csv
- **Purpose**: Track test execution status, results, and defect linking
- **Content**: Execution status, pass/fail results, tester assignments, defect IDs

## Usage Instructions

### For QA Engineers

1. **Test Case Execution**: Use CSV files in spreadsheet applications for execution tracking
2. **Independent Execution**: All test cases designed for execution without source code access
3. **Result Recording**: Update test-execution-matrix.csv with results and defects
4. **Coverage Validation**: Use coverage-matrix.csv to ensure complete testing

### For Test Managers

1. **Coverage Analysis**: Review matrices for coverage gaps and completeness
2. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor execution status across all test categories
3. **Quality Metrics**: Use coverage percentages and pass/fail rates for reporting
4. **Resource Planning**: Assign test cases based on priority and complexity

### For Development Teams

1. **Requirement Validation**: Ensure all requirements have corresponding test cases
2. **Design Verification**: Validate integration points through design-based tests
3. **Defect Analysis**: Link defects to specific test cases for impact analysis
4. **Documentation Sync**: Update test cases when requirements or design changes

## Coverage Criteria

### Functional Coverage

- 100% requirements coverage with positive and negative scenarios
- All documented acceptance criteria validated through test cases
- Business rule compliance verified through UAT scenarios

### Input Domain Coverage

- Equivalence partitioning for all input types (video, audio, user interactions)
- Boundary value analysis for numeric inputs (users, latency, frame rates)
- Negative testing for invalid inputs and error conditions

### Interface Coverage

- All documented API endpoints and WebSocket protocols
- WebRTC signaling, media transport, and data channel validation
- Cross-platform compatibility across supported browsers and devices

### Real-Time System Coverage

- Timing constraints (sub-500ms latency requirements)
- Concurrency scenarios (1000+ simultaneous users)
- Resource constraints (memory, CPU, bandwidth)
- Failure recovery scenarios (network interruption, device disconnection)

## Quality Standards

### Test Case Quality

- All test cases trace to documented requirements
- Test steps are action-based and independently executable
- Expected results are specific, observable, and measurable
- Pass/fail criteria are objective and unambiguous

### Documentation Standards

- CSV format for spreadsheet compatibility and execution tracking
- Consistent field naming and structure across all test categories
- Clear, concise language suitable for any tester
- Regular synchronization with source documentation updates

### Maintenance Procedures

- Monitor source documentation for changes and update test cases accordingly
- Perform regular coverage gap analysis and remediation
- Validate traceability matrix completeness and accuracy
- Review and update test cases based on execution feedback and defect analysis

## Getting Started

1. **Review Templates**: Start with templates/test-case-template.csv and testing-guidelines.md
2. **Understand Coverage**: Read coverage-criteria.md for comprehensive coverage requirements
3. **Execute Tests**: Import CSV files into spreadsheet applications for execution tracking
4. **Track Progress**: Use matrices for coverage analysis and execution monitoring
5. **Report Results**: Update execution matrix with results and generate coverage reports

For detailed guidelines on test case creation, execution, and maintenance, refer to the files in the templates/ directory.
