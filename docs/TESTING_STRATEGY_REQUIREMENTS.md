# Testing Strategy Requirements - Emotion Recognition PWA

## Introduction

This document defines comprehensive testing requirements for the emotion recognition PWA system to ensure reliable, scalable, and accurate performance across all components and usage scenarios. The testing strategy addresses the unique challenges of real-time WebRTC applications, AI-powered emotion recognition, and cross-platform PWA functionality.

**Problem**: Real-time emotion recognition systems require specialized testing approaches that traditional web application testing cannot address. The system must validate WebRTC streaming, AI model accuracy, cross-browser compatibility, and performance under high concurrent load while maintaining sub-500ms latency requirements.

**Analysis**: Testing challenges include: WebRTC connection simulation, emotion recognition accuracy validation, cross-platform compatibility verification, load testing with 1000+ concurrent users, and integration testing across 11 modular components.

**Decision**: Implement a multi-layered testing strategy with unit tests for individual modules, integration tests for module interactions, performance tests for scalability validation, and specialized tests for WebRTC and AI components.
