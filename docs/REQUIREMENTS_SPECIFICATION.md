## Browser Compatibility Requirements

### Requirement 38: Core Browser Support Matrix

**User Story:** As a user, I want the emotion recognition system to work reliably on my preferred browser, so that I can access the service regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN it will provide full functionality on major modern browsers
2. WHEN using supported browsers THEN all features will work including real-time streaming, PWA installation, camera access, and emotion overlays
3. WHEN using older browser versions THEN the system will detect capabilities and provide appropriate feature subsets or upgrade recommendations
4. WHEN browser market share changes THEN the support matrix will be reviewed quarterly and updated based on usage analytics
5. WHEN new browser versions are released THEN compatibility will be tested within 30 days of stable release

**Traceability:** Links to REQ-6 (cross-platform PWA), REQ-1 (camera access across browsers), REQ-2 (real-time communication compatibility)

### Requirement 39: Real-time Communication Browser Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time communication features to work consistently across different browsers, so that emotion recognition performs reliably regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing real-time connections THEN the system will handle browser-specific implementations of media capture, peer connection, and data channel APIs
2. WHEN codec negotiation occurs THEN the system will support VP8, H.264, and Opus codecs with fallbacks based on browser capabilities
3. WHEN ICE candidates are gathered THEN the system will handle different STUN/TURN server requirements across browsers
4. WHEN data channels are used THEN the system will accommodate browser differences in message size limits and delivery guarantees
5. WHEN real-time communication features are unavailable THEN the system will detect lack of support and provide alternative functionality or clear error messages

**Traceability:** Links to REQ-2 (real-time streaming), REQ-7 (media relay compatibility), REQ-3 (overlay data delivery)

### Requirement 40: Progressive Enhancement Strategy

**User Story:** As a user with an older browser, I want to access basic functionality even if advanced features aren't supported, so that I'm not completely excluded from using the emotion recognition system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature detection runs THEN the system will identify supported capabilities and enable appropriate feature sets
2. WHEN real-time communication is unsupported THEN the system will provide alternative functionality such as image upload for emotion analysis
3. WHEN PWA features are unavailable THEN the system will function as a standard responsive web application
4. WHEN modern JavaScript features are missing THEN the system will include appropriate polyfills or fallback implementations
5. WHEN browsers lack required features THEN the system will display clear upgrade recommendations with specific browser version requirements

**Traceability:** Links to REQ-6 (progressive web app), all core requirements (fallback functionality)

## Behavioral Scenarios (Gherkin Format)

The following scenarios provide detailed behavioral examples that illustrate how the requirements should be implemented and tested in real-world usage situations.

### **Core User Value Scenarios**

```gherkin
Feature: Real-time Emotion Recognition
  As a video call participant
  I want to see emotion overlays on my face
  So that I can better understand my emotional expressions

  Scenario: Successful emotion detection
    Given I have granted camera permissions
    When I smile at the camera
    Then I should see a "happy" overlay with >80% confidence
    And the overlay should update within 500ms

  Scenario: Cross-platform compatibility
    Given I'm using an iPhone Safari browser
    When I install the PWA
    Then emotion detection should work offline
    And camera access should be seamless

  Scenario: High concurrent usage
    Given 100 users are connected simultaneously
    When each user enables emotion detection
    Then the system should maintain <500ms latency
    And emotion accuracy should remain >85%
```

### **Technical Implementation Scenarios**

```gherkin
Feature: Modular Architecture
  As a system architect
  I want clearly defined module interfaces
  So that components can be developed and tested independently

  Scenario: Interface contract validation
    Given the MediaCaptureModule interface
    When implementing startCapture(config)
    Then it must return a MediaStream object
    And handle all permission error cases
    And support device switching

  Scenario: API versioning
    Given a shared interface
    When the emotion detection algorithm changes
    Then the interface should remain backward compatible
    And new features should be additive only
```
