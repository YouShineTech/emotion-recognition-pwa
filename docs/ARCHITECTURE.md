- **Core Processing Methods** (analyze, extract, generate): Implement the module's primary business logic
- **Configuration Methods** (setQuality, setMode): Enable system optimization and adaptation
- **Communication Methods** (send, receive, serialize): Handle data exchange between modules

This interface design ensures that modules can be developed independently while maintaining system integration through well-defined contracts.

## 🔗 API Contract Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the temporal flow of method calls and data exchange during a complete emotion recognition session. It demonstrates how the static module relationships translate into dynamic runtime interactions, showing the chronological sequence of API calls required to deliver end-to-end functionality.

        Server->>ML: AudioAnalysis.analyzeAudio()
        ML->>Server: Emotion predictions
        Server->>Server: OverlayDataGenerator.generateOverlay()
        Server->>Client: Overlay data via WebRTC data channel
        Client->>Client: OverlayRenderer.renderOverlay()
    end
```

### What This Diagram Conveys

The sequence diagram reveals several critical architectural patterns and timing requirements:

#### **Initialization Phase**

The diagram shows that system startup follows a specific order:

1. **User Interaction**: Human user initiates the process by granting device permissions
2. **Client Setup**: MediaCaptureModule handles browser security requirements before any media processing
3. **Server Preparation**: ConnectionManager and MediaRelay modules establish infrastructure before receiving media

This sequence is architecturally necessary because each step creates prerequisites for the next - media cannot be captured without permissions, and server resources must be allocated before media arrives.

#### **Real-Time Processing Loop**

The core processing cycle demonstrates the system's real-time architecture:

- **Continuous Media Flow**: Client streams media continuously, not in discrete requests
- **Parallel Processing**: Facial and audio analysis occur simultaneously on the server
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Data flows both directions - media to server, overlay data to client
- **Immediate Feedback**: Overlay rendering happens immediately upon receiving processed data

#### **Temporal Dependencies**

The diagram reveals critical timing relationships:

- **Sequential Setup**: Initial setup steps must complete in order
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Facial and audio processing can happen in parallel for performance
- **Synchronous Overlay Generation**: Emotion fusion waits for both analysis results
- **Asynchronous Rendering**: Client rendering doesn't block server processing

#### **System Boundaries**

The participant separation illustrates architectural boundaries:

- **User**: Represents human interaction points and permission requirements
- **Client**: Encapsulates browser-based modules and user interface responsibilities
- **Server**: Contains media processing and business logic modules
- **ML**: Represents external machine learning services and analysis engines

#### **Communication Patterns**

The message flows demonstrate different interaction patterns:

- **Request-Response**: Permission requests and session setup follow traditional patterns
- **Streaming**: Media transmission uses continuous data flow
- **Event-Driven**: Overlay updates trigger immediate rendering responses
- **Loop Processing**: Real-time analysis requires continuous processing cycles

#### **Error Handling Implications**

While not explicitly shown, the sequence implies error handling requirements:

- **Permission Failures**: Must be handled before any media processing begins
- **Connection Failures**: Could interrupt the real-time processing loop
- **Analysis Failures**: Should not stop the overall processing flow
- **Rendering Failures**: Should not affect server-side processing

This temporal view complements the static module relationships by showing how the system actually operates during runtime, revealing the dynamic behavior that emerges from the static architectural design.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Core Technology Choices

The following technologies were chosen as the best suited to build this solution:

### Real-Time Communication Protocol: WebRTC

**Why Required**: REQ-2 requires sub-500ms end-to-end latency for real-time emotion recognition, and BR-2 mandates this performance for acceptable user experience. Traditional web protocols cannot achieve this performance.

**Alternative Analysis**:

- **HTTP/REST APIs**: Request-response model adds round-trip latency (typically 100-300ms per request), cannot meet BR-2's <500ms requirement
- **WebSockets**: Persistent connection but lacks built-in media optimization and adaptive bitrate capabilities
- **WebRTC**: Peer-to-peer media streaming with minimal latency (typically 50-150ms), built-in adaptive bitrate, native browser support

**Selection Rationale**: WebRTC is the only web-standard protocol capable of achieving BR-2's <500ms latency requirement while providing the adaptive streaming capabilities specified in REQ-2.

### Server Runtime Environment: Node.js

**Why Required**: Real-time emotion recognition requires sub-500ms end-to-end latency with 1000+ concurrent users. The client-side must use JavaScript for browser compatibility, requiring a server-side ecosystem that can handle real-time media processing while maintaining development efficiency.

**Alternative Analysis**:

- **JavaScript/Node.js Ecosystem**: Event-driven, non-blocking I/O matches real-time media streaming requirements, Mediasoup (leading WebRTC SFU) is Node.js native, unified language eliminates client/server context switching
- **Python Ecosystem**: Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents true parallelism critical for concurrent media streams, different language requires duplicate interface definitions
- **Go Ecosystem**: Excellent concurrency but limited WebRTC server options, different language ecosystem requires separate development workflows

**Selection Rationale**: Node.js was chosen because Mediasoup (the most mature WebRTC SFU) is Node.js native, and the unified JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem enables shared interfaces and development efficiency without sacrificing real-time performance requirements.

### WebRTC Server Architecture: Mediasoup

**Why Required**: REQ-8 requires supporting 1000+ concurrent users, but direct peer-to-peer WebRTC connections cannot scale beyond small groups due to bandwidth limitations (each client would need 999 connections). A server-side architecture is required.

**Alternative Analysis**:

- **Mediasoup (SFU - Selective Forwarding Unit)**: Proven horizontal scaling to 1000+ users, Node.js native implementation, SFU architecture minimizes server processing, supports adaptive bitrate requirements
- **Kurento (MCU - Multipoint Control Unit)**: Deprecated project with limited support, MCU architecture requires server-side transcoding increasing latency, Java-based incompatible with Node.js ecosystem
- **Janus (SFU/MCU Hybrid)**: C-based implementation difficult to extend, limited documentation, plugin architecture adds complexity
- **Custom WebRTC Implementation**: Would require months of development time, high risk of latency and scaling issues, maintenance burden conflicts with rapid development

**Selection Rationale**: Mediasoup was chosen because its SFU architecture can scale to 1000+ users (REQ-8) while maintaining the <500ms latency requirement (BR-2), and its Node.js native implementation integrates seamlessly with the chosen technology ecosystem.

### Development Language: TypeScript

**Why Required**: Node.js runtime establishes JavaScript as the base language, but eleven modules communicating through interfaces create numerous opportunities for type mismatches and runtime errors.

**Alternative Analysis**:

- **JavaScript**: Native Node.js language but runtime type errors could cascade across module boundaries, causing system-wide failures
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time type checking prevents interface mismatches before deployment while maintaining full JavaScript ecosystem compatibility
- **Other Languages**: Would require separate runtimes, breaking the unified ecosystem advantage of Node.js

**Selection Rationale**: TypeScript provides compile-time validation across all module interfaces while leveraging the complete Node.js ecosystem.

### Build System: Webpack

**Why Required**: PWA applications require service worker management, asset optimization, and development server capabilities for WebRTC testing, all while supporting TypeScript compilation.

**Alternative Analysis**:

- **Webpack**: Mature PWA plugin ecosystem, extensive WebRTC development server support, proven TypeScript integration and source map generation
- **Vite**: Faster development builds but limited PWA tooling and WebRTC proxy capabilities
- **Rollup**: Excellent for libraries but lacks integrated development server for real-time testing

**Selection Rationale**: Webpack's mature PWA support and WebRTC development capabilities outweigh the build speed advantages of newer tools.

### Testing Framework: Jest

**Why Required**: Different testing frameworks between client and server create inconsistent mocking patterns and async handling approaches, especially with TypeScript compilation requirements.

**Alternative Analysis**:

- **Jest**: Comprehensive mocking for WebRTC APIs, native TypeScript support, snapshot testing for UI components, consistent async/await patterns
- **Vitest**: Faster execution but newer ecosystem with limited WebRTC mocking libraries
- **Mocha + Chai**: Flexible but requires additional configuration for TypeScript and WebRTC testing

**Selection Rationale**: Jest's mature WebRTC mocking capabilities and native TypeScript support create consistent patterns across client/server boundaries.

### How do we define interfaces that prevent runtime errors?

**The Problem**: Module interfaces must be validated at compile-time to prevent runtime failures in production.

**Interface Definition Analysis**:

- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Compile-time validation, IDE support, zero runtime overhead, consistent with language choice
- **JSON Schema**: Runtime validation only, no compile-time safety
- **Protocol Buffers**: Binary efficiency but adds complexity for web development

**Decision**: TypeScript interfaces provide compile-time safety with zero runtime overhead, matching our performance requirements.

### What integration risks emerge from combining these technologies?

**The Problem**: Individual technology choices may be optimal in isolation but create integration conflicts when combined. What specific compatibility issues must be resolved to ensure our selected technologies work together effectively?

**Integration Analysis**:

- **TypeScript + Webpack + Jest**: All three tools share the same module resolution system, enabling consistent import paths and type checking across development, testing, and build processes
- **Node.js + Mediasoup**: Both use event-driven architecture that aligns with real-time processing requirements without blocking I/O operations
- **npm + TypeScript**: Workspace support enables shared type definitions across client/server boundaries with automatic dependency resolution

**Architectural Consequence**: The technology stack creates a unified development environment where type safety, build processes, and testing strategies reinforce each other rather than requiring separate toolchains for different system components.

## Project Structure Design

### Intended Directory Architecture

The system shall be organized as a monorepo structure using a modular directory layout that separates concerns and enables independent development:

```

### Directory Design Rationale

**Monorepo Structure**: A single repository containing both client and server code enables:

- Shared interface definitions with guaranteed synchronization
- Atomic commits across client/server boundaries
- Simplified dependency management for shared components
- Coordinated versioning and release management
- Unified development tooling and CI/CD pipelines

**Client/Server Separation**: Physical separation within the monorepo enables independent deployment, scaling, and technology choices for frontend and backend concerns.

**Module Organization**: Each module resides in its own directory to enable:

- Independent development by different teams
- Isolated testing and validation
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Technology substitution without affecting other modules

**Shared Interface Layer**: Centralized interface definitions ensure:

- Consistent contracts between client and server modules
- Type safety across module boundaries
- Clear documentation of inter-module communication
- Version management for interface evolution

**Documentation Separation**: Architecture documentation is separated from code to:

- Maintain design decisions independent of implementation changes
- Enable review by non-technical stakeholders
- Provide stable reference during development phases

### Path Alias Configuration Intent

The system shall use a standardized `@` path alias that resolves to the workspace root to enable consistent imports across all modules:

**Client Configuration**: `@/*` shall resolve to `../` (workspace root from client perspective)
**Server Configuration**: `@/*` shall resolve to `../` (workspace root from server perspective)

**Import Pattern Intent**:

```typescript
// All modules will use consistent @ imports regardless of their location
import { MediaCaptureModule } from '@/shared/interfaces/[media-capture-interface]';
import { EmotionScore } from '@/shared/interfaces/[common-interface]';
```

**Path Alias Rationale**: This approach ensures:

- **Location Independence**: Modules can be moved without changing import statements
- **Consistent Imports**: All modules use the same import pattern regardless of nesting depth
- **Refactoring Safety**: Directory restructuring doesn't break import paths
- **Developer Experience**: Predictable import paths reduce cognitive load
- **Build Tool Compatibility**: Standard alias pattern works across TypeScript, Webpack, and Jest

## Interface Architecture Decision

### Distributed Interface Design Intent

The system shall use distributed interface definitions with explicit module imports. Each module will import only the specific interface contracts it requires, avoiding central interface registries or monolithic interface collections.

**Design Intent**: Interface files will be organized in a `shared/interfaces/` directory with one interface per module responsibility to enable independent development and testing.

### Intended Interface Dependency Structure

The system will enforce a hierarchical interface dependency structure to prevent circular dependencies and enable independent module development:

**Foundation Layer**: A common interface will provide base types shared across multiple modules
**Module Layer**: Each module will define its specific interface contract
**Integration Layer**: Cross-module interfaces will handle data exchange between processing stages

**Design Rationale**: This structure is intended to allow parallel development teams to work independently while ensuring system integration through well-defined contracts.

### Intended Interface Dependencies

The following diagram shows the planned interface dependency relationships for this system:

```mermaid
graph TD
    CI[common.interface] --> MCI[media-capture.interface]
    CI --> WTI[webrtc-transport.interface]
    CI --> CMI[connection-manager.interface]
    CI --> AAI[audio-analysis.interface]
    CI --> FAI[facial-analysis.interface]

    MRI[media-relay.interface] --> FEI[frame-extraction.interface]
    FEI --> FAI
    FEI --> AAI

    AAI --> OGI[overlay-data.interface]
    FAI --> OGI
    CI --> OGI

    OGI --> ORI[overlay-renderer.interface]

    PSI[pwa-shell.interface]
    NWI[nginx-server.interface]
```

**Dependency Design Intent**: This hierarchy is designed to ensure that:

- Common types will be shared without duplication
- Processing modules will access frame extraction interfaces
- Data fusion modules will combine analysis results
- Client rendering modules will receive unified overlay data
- Standalone modules (PWA, Nginx) will remain independent

### Interface Contract Specifications

Each interface in this system shall specify:

- **Method signatures** with precise parameter and return types
- **Error conditions** using a standardized ModuleError interface
- **Performance expectations** for latency-critical operations
- **Data formats** using shared type definitions from the common interface

**Version Management Intent**: All interfaces will include version identifiers to support system evolution without breaking existing implementations.

**The Problem**: Technologies become obsolete over time (e.g., if Mediasoup is deprecated, if WebRTC standards change). How do we architect for long-term technology evolution?

**Technology Evolution Analysis**:

- **Abstraction Layers**:
  - Interface-based module design enables technology substitution
  - WebRTC abstraction allows migration to future real-time protocols
  - AI processing abstraction supports different emotion recognition models
  - Database abstraction enables storage technology changes

- **Migration Planning**:
  - Technology roadmap monitoring for all core dependencies
  - Proof-of-concept development for alternative technologies
  - Gradual migration strategies with parallel system operation
  - Performance benchmarking for technology alternatives

- **Future-Proofing Strategies**:
  - Standards-based implementations over proprietary solutions
  - Modular architecture enabling incremental technology updates
  - Configuration-driven technology selection where possible
  - Documentation of technology decision rationale for future reference

**Technology Evolution Decision**: Interface-based abstraction with planned migration strategies and continuous technology evaluation to ensure long-term system viability and performance.

### How do we scale the development process as the system grows?

**The Problem**: As the system matures and the team grows, development processes must scale without compromising quality or security. How do we maintain architectural integrity?

**Development Scaling Analysis**:

- **Code Quality Maintenance**:
  - Automated code review with security and performance checks
  - Architecture decision records (ADRs) for all major changes
  - Regular architecture reviews and refactoring cycles
  - Technical debt tracking and remediation planning

- **Team Scaling**:
  - Module ownership model with clear boundaries
  - Cross-team interface contracts and versioning
  - Shared development standards and tooling
  - Knowledge sharing and documentation requirements

- **Release Management**:
  - Feature flag-based deployment for gradual rollouts
  - Canary deployment strategies for risk mitigation
  - Automated rollback triggers based on performance metrics
  - Release train scheduling for coordinated updates

**Development Scaling Decision**: Structured development processes with automated quality gates, clear ownership models, and risk-mitigated deployment strategies to maintain system quality as development complexity increases.
