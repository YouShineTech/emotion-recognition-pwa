# CI/CD Pipeline Specification

## Overview

This document describes the CI/CD pipeline implementation that ensures compliance with all requirements specified in `docs/REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md`. The pipeline enforces quality gates, security standards, and performance requirements before code reaches production.

## Pipeline Architecture
