# üöÄ DevOps Quick Start Guide

## üéØ **One-Command Setup**

Run the complete DevOps setup:

```bash
./scripts/devops-setup.sh
```

## üìã **What Gets Created**

### ‚úÖ **Configuration Files**

- `.env.template` - Environment variables template
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production deployment
- `docker-compose.staging.yml` - Staging deployment
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Complete CI/CD pipeline

### ‚úÖ **Monitoring Stack**

- **Prometheus** at http://localhost:9090
- **Grafana** at http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin123)
- **Node Exporter** for system metrics

### ‚úÖ **DevOps Scripts**

- `./scripts/devops/health-check.sh` - Service health monitoring
- `./scripts/devops/deploy.sh` - Multi-environment deployment
- `./scripts/devops/backup.sh` - Automated backups
- `./scripts/devops/logs.sh` - Log aggregation

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Quick Start Commands**

### **1. Initial Setup**

```bash
# Run the setup script
./scripts/devops-setup.sh

# Configure environment
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your values
```

### **2. Local Development**

```bash
# Start all services
./scripts/devops/deploy.sh local

# Check health
./scripts/devops/health-check.sh

# View logs
./scripts/devops/logs.sh
```

### **3. Monitoring**

```bash
# Start monitoring stack
cd monitoring && docker-compose up -d

# Access dashboards
open http://localhost:3001  # Grafana
open http://localhost:9090  # Prometheus
```

### **4. Staging Deployment**

```bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/devops/deploy.sh staging

# Run health checks
./scripts/devops/health-check.sh
```

## üéì **Training Schedule**

- Day 5: Environment configuration

### **Week 2: CI/CD**

- Day 1: Study GitHub Actions workflow
- Day 2: Test pipeline locally with `act`
- Day 3: Deploy to staging
- Day 4: Monitor deployment metrics
- Day 5: Practice rollbacks

### **Week 3: Monitoring**

- Day 1: Set up Prometheus + Grafana
- Day 2: Create custom dashboards
- Day 3: Configure alerts
- Day 4: Performance tuning
- Day 5: Incident response drills

## üîß **Essential Commands Cheat Sheet**

### **Docker Commands**

```bash
# Build and run
docker-compose up --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Scale services
docker-compose up -d --scale server=3

# Clean up
docker-compose down -v
```

### **Health Monitoring**

```bash
# Check all services
./scripts/devops/health-check.sh

# Check specific service
./scripts/devops/health-check.sh | grep server

# Monitor resources
docker stats
```

### **Log Management**

```bash
# All service logs
./scripts/devops/logs.sh

# Specific service logs
./scripts/devops/logs.sh server

# Real-time monitoring
./scripts/devops/logs.sh | tail -f
```

### **Backup & Recovery**

```bash
# Create backup
./scripts/devops/backup.sh

# List backups
ls -la backups/

# Restore from backup
# (Manual process - see DEVOPS_TRAINING.md)
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **Port conflicts**

   ```bash
   # Check what's using ports
   lsof -i :3000
   lsof -i :3001
   ```

2. **Permission issues**

   ```bash
   # Fix script permissions
   chmod +x scripts/devops/*.sh
   ```

3. **Docker issues**
   ```bash
   # Reset Docker environment
   docker system prune -f
   docker-compose down -v
   ```
