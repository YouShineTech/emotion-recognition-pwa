- Production deployment

### Task 8: Maintenance & Support

**Duration**: Ongoing
**Focus**: System health and issue management

**Key Components**:

- Centralized logging system
- Issue tracking and classification
- Help desk support tools
- Diagnostic scripts

### Task 9: Security & Updates

**Duration**: Ongoing
**Focus**: Vulnerability management and library updates

**Key Components**:

- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Library update management
- Security update deployment pipeline
- Compliance tracking

```

### Recommended Structure

All implementation documentation should reside in `docs/` for consistency with existing documentation standards.

## Quick Reference Commands

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:integration

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Security Commands

```bash
# Daily security scan
npm run security:scan:daily

# Update critical vulnerabilities
npm run security:update:critical

# Security status check
npm run help-desk:security:status
```

### Help Desk Commands

```bash
# System health check
npm run health:check

# User issue investigation
npm run help-desk:investigate --issue-id=ISSUE-001

# Performance analysis
npm run help-desk:performance --time-range=24h
```

## Module Development Ruleset Compliance

### ✅ Progressive Development

- Early integration (Task 2)
- Incremental module addition
- Continuous testing at each stage

### ✅ Simplicity Bias

- Minimal foundation (Tasks 0-1)
- Core functionality first
- Justified complexity additions

### ✅ Clear Boundaries

- Infrastructure separate from modules
- Distinct phases for development, commissioning, maintenance
- Security management as separate responsibility

### ✅ Failure Isolation

- Standalone PoCs for each module
- Integration validation at each step
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics

- **Latency**: <500ms end-to-end
- **Accuracy**: >80% emotion detection
- **Capacity**: 100+ concurrent users
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability

### Operational Metrics

- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Maintenance**: <2 hour MTTR for critical issues
- **Updates**: <24h for critical security patches
- **Support**: <15min response for critical issues

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** this implementation plan
2. **Begin Task 0-1**: Foundation setup
3. **Establish development environment**
4. **Create core module stubs**
5. **Validate basic infrastructure**

This plan provides a complete roadmap from initial development through ongoing maintenance and security management.
