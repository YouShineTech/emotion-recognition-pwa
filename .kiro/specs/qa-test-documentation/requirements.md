# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive formal test case documentation structure for the Emotion Recognition PWA project. The documentation will provide QA engineers and testers with structured test cases, matrices, and scenarios to ensure thorough manual and acceptance testing coverage beyond the existing automated unit and integration tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want structured test case matrices derived from requirements specification and design documents, so that I can systematically execute manual tests with complete independence from source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating test cases THEN each test case SHALL be derived exclusively from documents in docs/ directory (requirements, design, architecture, business rules)
2. WHEN reviewing test cases THEN each test case SHALL include test ID, description, preconditions, numbered action steps, and expected results for each step
3. WHEN executing tests THEN test steps SHALL be action-based from user/system perspective enabling independent execution by any tester
4. WHEN organizing test cases THEN tests SHALL be grouped by functional requirements and apply category partitioning and classification tree methods

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a test manager, I want system test cases based on requirements specification that apply coverage criteria, so that I can ensure complete functional validation through documentation-driven testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating system test cases THEN tests SHALL be derived from REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md and BUSINESS_RULES.md only
2. WHEN applying coverage criteria THEN test cases SHALL use boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning methods
3. WHEN designing test scenarios THEN tests SHALL cover good path (positive) and bad path (negative) scenarios systematically
4. WHEN executing system tests THEN each test case SHALL be traceable to specific requirement statements in the requirements specification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want integration test cases based on design and architecture documentation, so that I can validate module interactions and system integration points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating integration tests THEN test cases SHALL be derived from DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md documents
2. WHEN testing module interactions THEN test cases SHALL validate interfaces and data flow between system components as documented
3. WHEN executing integration tests THEN each test step SHALL specify user/system actions with corresponding expected results
4. WHEN validating system integration THEN test cases SHALL cover both successful integration scenarios and integration failure conditions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want boundary value and equivalence partitioning test cases derived from documented system limits, so that I can systematically validate input handling and system constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying boundary value analysis THEN test cases SHALL identify boundaries from requirements specification and test valid boundary, invalid boundary, and just-outside-boundary values
2. WHEN applying equivalence partitioning THEN test cases SHALL partition input domains based on documented system behavior and test representative values from each partition
3. WHEN testing system limits THEN boundary tests SHALL validate documented performance thresholds (1000+ users, <500ms latency) from requirements
4. WHEN executing boundary tests THEN each test case SHALL include step number, action, and expected result for independent execution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a test manager, I want regression test suites organized by documented functional areas, so that I can systematically validate system stability across releases using documentation-based test cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing regression tests THEN test suites SHALL be structured by functional areas defined in requirements and design documentation
2. WHEN selecting regression tests THEN test cases SHALL be prioritized based on criticality levels documented in requirements specification
3. WHEN executing regression tests THEN test cases SHALL be independently executable with clear action steps and expected results
4. WHEN tracking regression coverage THEN test matrices SHALL map to specific documented requirements and design components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want user acceptance test cases based on business rules and user scenarios, so that I can validate end-user workflows from a business perspective using documented requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating UAT cases THEN test cases SHALL be derived from business rules documentation and user workflow requirements
2. WHEN designing user scenarios THEN test cases SHALL follow classification tree method to systematically cover user interaction paths
3. WHEN executing UAT tests THEN each test case SHALL contain numbered steps with user actions and expected system responses
4. WHEN validating business requirements THEN UAT test cases SHALL directly trace to business rule statements and user story acceptance criteria

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want negative test cases derived from documented error conditions and constraints, so that I can systematically validate system error handling and boundary violations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating negative test cases THEN tests SHALL be based on error conditions and constraints documented in requirements and design specifications
2. WHEN testing invalid inputs THEN negative test cases SHALL apply equivalence partitioning to systematically test invalid input classes
3. WHEN validating error handling THEN test cases SHALL specify expected error messages and system behavior as documented in specifications
4. WHEN executing negative tests THEN each test case SHALL include step-by-step actions to trigger error conditions with expected error responses

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a QA manager, I want test case format that ensures independent execution, so that any tester can execute test cases without additional clarification or source code access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting test cases THEN each test case SHALL include test ID, objective, preconditions, numbered steps, and expected results per step
2. WHEN writing test steps THEN each step SHALL be action-based with clear user/system perspective and measurable expected outcomes
3. WHEN organizing test documentation THEN test cases SHALL be structured in CSV/spreadsheet format for easy tracking and execution
4. WHEN executing test cases THEN testers SHALL be able to perform all steps independently using only the documented test case information

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a test manager, I want comprehensive traceability through numeric identifiers, so that I can track relationships between requirements, design elements, business rules, and test cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating test cases THEN each test case SHALL have a unique numeric identifier (e.g., TC-001, TC-002)
2. WHEN referencing requirements THEN test cases SHALL link to specific requirement IDs from requirements specification (e.g., REQ-001, REQ-002)
3. WHEN tracing to design elements THEN test cases SHALL reference design constraint IDs and architecture component IDs from design documentation
4. WHEN establishing traceability THEN the system SHALL provide traceability matrices showing relationships between requirement IDs, business rule IDs, design IDs, and test case IDs

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive coverage criteria applied to test case design, so that I can ensure systematic and complete testing of the real-time emotion recognition system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying functional coverage THEN test cases SHALL achieve 100% requirements coverage with each documented requirement having at least one positive and one negative test case
2. WHEN applying input domain coverage THEN test cases SHALL use equivalence partitioning for all input types (video streams, audio streams, user interactions, device permissions) and boundary value analysis for all numeric inputs (frame rates, audio sample rates, concurrent users, latency thresholds)
3. WHEN applying real-time system coverage THEN test cases SHALL cover timing constraints (sub-500ms latency), concurrency scenarios (1000+ simultaneous users), resource constraints (memory, CPU, bandwidth), and failure recovery scenarios (network interruption, device disconnection, server overload)
4. WHEN applying interface coverage THEN test cases SHALL validate all documented API endpoints, WebRTC signaling protocols, data format specifications, and cross-platform compatibility requirements (mobile, tablet, desktop browsers)
