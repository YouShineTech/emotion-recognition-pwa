# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable building the emotion recognition PWA server as a Debian package (.deb file) that can be easily distributed and installed on cloud servers. The package will automatically handle dependency installation, service configuration, and system integration, providing a professional deployment solution that follows Linux packaging standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to install the emotion recognition server using a single .deb package, so that I can deploy it quickly without manual dependency management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `dpkg -i emotion-recognition-server.deb` THEN the system SHALL install all required dependencies automatically
2. WHEN the package is installed THEN the system SHALL create a systemd service for the emotion recognition server
3. WHEN the package is installed THEN the system SHALL create appropriate user accounts and file permissions
4. WHEN the package is installed THEN the system SHALL place configuration files in standard Linux locations (/etc/emotion-recognition/)
5. IF Node.js is not installed THEN the package SHALL install the correct Node.js version as a dependency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the .deb package to include proper service management, so that the server can be controlled using standard systemd commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is installed THEN the system SHALL create a systemd service file at /etc/systemd/system/emotion-recognition.service
2. WHEN I run `systemctl start emotion-recognition` THEN the service SHALL start successfully
3. WHEN I run `systemctl enable emotion-recognition` THEN the service SHALL be configured to start on boot
4. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL run as a non-root user (emotion-recognition)
5. WHEN the service fails THEN systemd SHALL attempt to restart it automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a build script that creates the .deb package from the source code, so that I can generate deployment packages as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `npm run build:deb` THEN the system SHALL create a .deb package in the dist/ directory
2. WHEN building the package THEN the system SHALL include the compiled server application
3. WHEN building the package THEN the system SHALL include all production dependencies
4. WHEN building the package THEN the system SHALL generate proper package metadata (version, description, dependencies)
5. WHEN building the package THEN the system SHALL create installation/removal scripts (postinst, prerm, postrm)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the package to handle configuration management properly, so that I can customize the server settings without breaking the installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is installed THEN it SHALL create a default configuration file at /etc/emotion-recognition/config.json
2. WHEN I modify the configuration file THEN package updates SHALL preserve my custom settings
3. WHEN the package is removed THEN it SHALL ask whether to keep configuration files
4. WHEN environment variables are set THEN they SHALL override configuration file settings
5. IF the configuration file is missing THEN the service SHALL start with sensible defaults

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper logging and file management, so that the server integrates well with system monitoring and log rotation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service runs THEN it SHALL write logs to /var/log/emotion-recognition/
2. WHEN the package is installed THEN it SHALL configure logrotate for automatic log rotation
3. WHEN the service runs THEN it SHALL create PID files in /var/run/emotion-recognition/
4. WHEN the package is installed THEN it SHALL set appropriate file permissions for security
5. WHEN the package is removed THEN it SHALL clean up log files and runtime directories

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the package to support different deployment environments, so that I can use the same package for staging and production with different configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install the package THEN it SHALL support environment-specific configuration files
2. WHEN I set NODE_ENV=production THEN the service SHALL use production-optimized settings
3. WHEN I provide custom SSL certificates THEN the service SHALL use them for HTTPS
4. WHEN Redis is available THEN the service SHALL connect to it automatically
5. IF external dependencies are unavailable THEN the service SHALL start in degraded mode with appropriate warnings
