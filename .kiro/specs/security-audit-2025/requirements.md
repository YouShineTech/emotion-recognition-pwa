# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive security audit of the emotion recognition PWA system using the latest security information and best practices from Context7. The audit will ensure the system is protected against current vulnerabilities and follows modern security standards for real-time WebRTC applications, Node.js backends, and PWA frontends.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities, so that the system is protected against security exploits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security audit is performed THEN the system SHALL scan all package.json files for vulnerable dependencies
2. WHEN vulnerable dependencies are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific upgrade paths and security patches
3. WHEN Socket.IO dependencies are analyzed THEN the system SHALL verify protection against CVE-2022-41940 and CVE-2022-2421
4. WHEN Express.js dependencies are analyzed THEN the system SHALL verify protection against path traversal, open redirect, and timing attack vulnerabilities
5. WHEN mediasoup dependencies are analyzed THEN the system SHALL verify proper SCTP stack configuration and fuzzing test coverage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to validate authentication and authorization mechanisms, so that only authorized users can access the system and its features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Socket.IO connections are established THEN the system SHALL enforce proper authentication using the auth payload
2. WHEN WebRTC connections are initiated THEN the system SHALL validate client certificates and DTLS handshakes
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL verify JWT tokens or session-based authentication
4. WHEN admin interfaces are accessed THEN the system SHALL require multi-factor authentication
5. WHEN cross-origin requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate CORS policies and credentials

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure secure communication channels, so that all data transmission is encrypted and protected from interception.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebRTC connections are established THEN the system SHALL use DTLS for data channel encryption
2. WHEN Socket.IO connections are made THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS/WSS protocols
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.2 or higher
4. WHEN media streams are transmitted THEN the system SHALL use SRTP for encryption
5. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL use proper encryption at rest

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to verify data protection and privacy controls, so that user data is handled according to privacy regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user media is captured THEN the system SHALL obtain explicit consent
2. WHEN emotion data is processed THEN the system SHALL implement data minimization principles
3. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL provide secure session termination
4. WHEN logs are generated THEN the system SHALL exclude personally identifiable information
5. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL implement proper data anonymization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to validate infrastructure security configurations, so that the deployment environment is hardened against attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker containers are deployed THEN the system SHALL run with non-root users and minimal privileges
2. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL protect sensitive configuration data
3. WHEN network policies are applied THEN the system SHALL restrict unnecessary port access
4. WHEN monitoring is configured THEN the system SHALL detect and alert on security events
5. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL encrypt backup data and secure storage access

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessment, so that potential attack vectors are identified and mitigated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fuzzing tests are executed THEN the system SHALL test WebRTC, SCTP, and HTTP protocol handlers
2. WHEN injection attacks are simulated THEN the system SHALL prevent SQL, NoSQL, and command injection
3. WHEN denial-of-service attacks are tested THEN the system SHALL maintain service availability
4. WHEN man-in-the-middle attacks are simulated THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent interception
5. WHEN social engineering attacks are tested THEN the system SHALL validate user awareness and training needs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to validate security architecture and design patterns, so that the system follows security-by-design principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system architecture is reviewed THEN it SHALL implement defense-in-depth strategies
2. WHEN error handling is analyzed THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information in error messages
3. WHEN rate limiting is configured THEN the system SHALL prevent abuse and resource exhaustion
4. WHEN input validation is implemented THEN the system SHALL sanitize all user inputs
5. WHEN security headers are configured THEN the system SHALL include appropriate HTTP security headers

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a maintenance engineer, I want to establish ongoing security monitoring and incident response procedures, so that security threats are detected and addressed promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log and alert appropriate personnel
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL have documented response procedures
3. WHEN security patches are available THEN the system SHALL have automated update mechanisms
4. WHEN security incidents are reported THEN the system SHALL have escalation and communication procedures
5. WHEN security audits are completed THEN the system SHALL track remediation progress and compliance status
