# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Progressive Web App (PWA) that captures live video and audio from a user's webcam, streams it to a cloud backend for real-time facial and voice emotion recognition processing, and displays emotion overlay metadata on the live video feed. The system uses real-time communication protocols for media streaming and AI models for emotion detection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my device's camera and microphone through the PWA, so that I can stream live video and audio for emotion analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the PWA THEN the system will request camera and microphone permissions
2. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system will display the live video feed from the webcam
3. WHEN permissions are denied THEN the system will display an appropriate error message and guidance
4. IF the device has multiple cameras THEN the system will allow the user to select which camera to use
5. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system will indicate recording status to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my live video and audio to be streamed to the cloud backend in real-time, so that emotion analysis can be performed without significant delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the video feed is active THEN the system will establish a real-time connection to the cloud backend
2. WHEN the real-time connection is established THEN the system will stream both video and audio data
3. IF the connection is lost THEN the system will attempt to reconnect automatically
4. WHEN streaming THEN the system will maintain low latency (< 500ms end-to-end)
5. IF network conditions degrade THEN the system will adapt video quality to maintain connection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see emotion analysis results overlaid on my live video feed, so that I can understand the detected emotions in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emotion data is received from the backend THEN the system will display overlay graphics on the video
2. WHEN facial emotions are detected THEN the system will draw bounding boxes around detected faces
3. WHEN facial emotions are detected THEN the system will display emotion labels with confidence scores
4. WHEN voice emotions are detected THEN the system will display audio emotion indicators
5. WHEN no emotions are detected THEN the system will display the clean video feed without overlays
6. WHEN overlay data is outdated (>2 seconds) THEN the system will hide the overlay elements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the cloud backend to process video streams using OpenFace for facial analysis, so that accurate facial emotion recognition can be performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video data is received THEN the backend will process frames for facial analysis
2. WHEN faces are detected THEN the system will extract facial landmarks and emotion features
3. WHEN emotion analysis is complete THEN the system will generate emotion classification results
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system will log errors and continue with next frame
5. WHEN multiple faces are detected THEN the system will process each face independently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the cloud backend to analyze audio streams for voice emotion recognition, so that comprehensive emotion analysis can be provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio data is received THEN the backend will process audio using AI emotion models
2. WHEN voice emotions are detected THEN the system will classify emotion types and confidence levels
3. WHEN audio processing is complete THEN the system will combine results with facial analysis
4. WHEN audio quality is poor THEN the system will indicate low confidence in results
5. WHEN no speech is detected THEN the system will skip audio emotion analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PWA to work on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop browsers, so that I can use the emotion recognition feature across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the PWA will provide native app-like experience
2. WHEN accessed on tablets THEN the system will optimize layout for tablet screen sizes
3. WHEN accessed on desktop browsers THEN the system will utilize available screen real estate
4. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system will adapt the interface accordingly
5. WHEN offline THEN the PWA will display appropriate offline messaging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to provide scalable real-time media relay, so that multiple users can be supported simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users connect THEN the system will handle concurrent real-time media sessions
2. WHEN system load increases THEN the system will efficiently manage media routing
3. WHEN a user disconnects THEN the system will clean up associated resources
4. WHEN server capacity is reached THEN the system will gracefully reject new connections
5. WHEN media relay fails THEN the system will attempt recovery or notify the client

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to handle 1000 simultaneous connections without performance degradation, so that the system can scale to support a large user base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 1000 users are connected simultaneously THEN the system will maintain the same response times as with fewer users
2. WHEN approaching 1000 connections THEN the system will monitor and report performance metrics
3. WHEN at maximum capacity THEN emotion recognition accuracy will not degrade below acceptable thresholds
4. WHEN load testing with 1000 connections THEN end-to-end latency will remain under 500ms
5. WHEN system resources are stressed THEN the backend will maintain stability without crashes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time feedback on system performance and connection status, so that I understand if the emotion recognition is working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is processing THEN the user will see connection status indicators
2. WHEN latency is high THEN the system will display performance warnings
3. WHEN processing fails THEN the system will show error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN the system is working normally THEN status indicators will show green/positive state
5. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system will display quality adjustment notifications
