# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Progressive Web App (PWA) that captures live video and audio from a user's webcam, streams it to a cloud backend for real-time facial and voice emotion recognition processing, and displays emotion overlay metadata on the live video feed. The system uses WebRTC for real-time communication, OpenFace for facial analysis, and AI models for audio emotion detection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my device's camera and microphone through the PWA, so that I can stream live video and audio for emotion analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the PWA THEN the system SHALL request camera and microphone permissions
2. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL display the live video feed from the webcam
3. WHEN permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and guidance
4. IF the device has multiple cameras THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select which camera to use
5. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system SHALL indicate recording status to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my live video and audio to be streamed to the cloud backend in real-time, so that emotion analysis can be performed without significant delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the video feed is active THEN the system SHALL establish a WebRTC connection to the cloud backend
2. WHEN the WebRTC connection is established THEN the system SHALL stream both video and audio data
3. IF the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
4. WHEN streaming THEN the system SHALL maintain low latency (< 500ms end-to-end)
5. IF network conditions degrade THEN the system SHALL adapt video quality to maintain connection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see emotion analysis results overlaid on my live video feed, so that I can understand the detected emotions in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emotion data is received from the backend THEN the system SHALL display overlay graphics on the video
2. WHEN facial emotions are detected THEN the system SHALL draw bounding boxes around detected faces
3. WHEN facial emotions are detected THEN the system SHALL display emotion labels with confidence scores
4. WHEN voice emotions are detected THEN the system SHALL display audio emotion indicators
5. WHEN no emotions are detected THEN the system SHALL display the clean video feed without overlays
6. WHEN overlay data is outdated (>2 seconds) THEN the system SHALL hide the overlay elements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the cloud backend to process video streams using OpenFace for facial analysis, so that accurate facial emotion recognition can be performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video data is received THEN the backend SHALL process frames using OpenFace
2. WHEN faces are detected THEN the system SHALL extract facial landmarks and emotion features
3. WHEN emotion analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate emotion classification results
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with next frame
5. WHEN multiple faces are detected THEN the system SHALL process each face independently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the cloud backend to analyze audio streams for voice emotion recognition, so that comprehensive emotion analysis can be provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio data is received THEN the backend SHALL process audio using AI emotion models
2. WHEN voice emotions are detected THEN the system SHALL classify emotion types and confidence levels
3. WHEN audio processing is complete THEN the system SHALL combine results with facial analysis
4. WHEN audio quality is poor THEN the system SHALL indicate low confidence in results
5. WHEN no speech is detected THEN the system SHALL skip audio emotion analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PWA to work on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop browsers, so that I can use the emotion recognition feature across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the PWA SHALL provide native app-like experience
2. WHEN accessed on tablets THEN the system SHALL optimize layout for tablet screen sizes
3. WHEN accessed on desktop browsers THEN the system SHALL utilize available screen real estate
4. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface accordingly
5. WHEN offline THEN the PWA SHALL display appropriate offline messaging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to use Mediasoup for scalable WebRTC media relay, so that multiple users can be supported simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users connect THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent WebRTC sessions
2. WHEN system load increases THEN Mediasoup SHALL efficiently manage media routing
3. WHEN a user disconnects THEN the system SHALL clean up associated resources
4. WHEN server capacity is reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully reject new connections
5. WHEN media relay fails THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery or notify the client

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to handle 1000 simultaneous connections without performance degradation, so that the system can scale to support a large user base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 1000 users are connected simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain the same response times as with fewer users
2. WHEN approaching 1000 connections THEN the system SHALL monitor and report performance metrics
3. WHEN at maximum capacity THEN emotion recognition accuracy SHALL not degrade below acceptable thresholds
4. WHEN load testing with 1000 connections THEN end-to-end latency SHALL remain under 500ms
5. WHEN system resources are stressed THEN the backend SHALL maintain stability without crashes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time feedback on system performance and connection status, so that I understand if the emotion recognition is working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is processing THEN the user SHALL see connection status indicators
2. WHEN latency is high THEN the system SHALL display performance warnings
3. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL show error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN the system is working normally THEN status indicators SHALL show green/positive state
5. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL display quality adjustment notifications
