# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The POC (Proof of Concept) completion project aims to achieve 100% functionality across all 11 POC modules that validate the core system specifications. Currently, 7 out of 11 POCs are working (63.6% success rate), but 4 POCs are failing due to compilation errors, missing dependencies, and API mismatches. All POCs must be completed and validated before the production system can proceed, as per business rules and specifications.

The failing POCs are:

- POC 03: Media Relay (Mediasoup integration issues)
- POC 09: Connection Manager (API interface mismatches)
- POC 10: PWA Shell (Missing dependencies and browser API mocks)
- POC 11: Nginx Server (Missing dependencies and configuration issues)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: POC 03 Media Relay Completion

**User Story:** As a system validator, I want the Media Relay POC to execute successfully, so that I can validate the Mediasoup SFU integration works correctly in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Media Relay POC is executed THEN the system SHALL complete without compilation errors
2. WHEN the POC runs THEN the system SHALL successfully initialize Mediasoup workers and routers
3. WHEN media relay functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper SFU capabilities
4. WHEN the POC completes THEN the system SHALL report success status and execution metrics

### Requirement 2: POC 09 Connection Manager Completion

**User Story:** As a system validator, I want the Connection Manager POC to execute successfully, so that I can validate session management and participant handling works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Connection Manager POC is executed THEN the system SHALL complete without TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN session management is tested THEN the system SHALL properly create, manage, and clean up sessions
3. WHEN participant operations are tested THEN the system SHALL handle joining, leaving, and status updates correctly
4. WHEN health monitoring is tested THEN the system SHALL track connection quality and participant timeouts
5. WHEN the POC completes THEN the system SHALL demonstrate all connection management features

### Requirement 3: POC 10 PWA Shell Completion

**User Story:** As a system validator, I want the PWA Shell POC to execute successfully, so that I can validate Progressive Web App features work correctly in a Node.js testing environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PWA Shell POC is executed THEN the system SHALL complete without missing dependency errors
2. WHEN browser APIs are mocked THEN the system SHALL provide proper Jest mocks for service workers, notifications, and storage
3. WHEN PWA features are tested THEN the system SHALL validate service worker registration, caching, and offline capabilities
4. WHEN installation features are tested THEN the system SHALL demonstrate app installation prompts and management
5. WHEN the POC completes THEN the system SHALL report successful PWA feature validation

### Requirement 4: POC 11 Nginx Server Completion

**User Story:** As a system validator, I want the Nginx Server POC to execute successfully, so that I can validate web server configuration and proxy capabilities work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Nginx Server POC is executed THEN the system SHALL complete without missing dependency errors
2. WHEN server configuration is tested THEN the system SHALL properly initialize Express server with middleware
3. WHEN proxy functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL demonstrate request forwarding and load balancing
4. WHEN health checks are tested THEN the system SHALL validate backend monitoring and status reporting
5. WHEN the POC completes THEN the system SHALL demonstrate all web server capabilities

### Requirement 5: POC Validation and Integration

**User Story:** As a system validator, I want all POCs to achieve 100% success rate, so that I can confirm the production system is built on validated foundations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all POCs are executed THEN the system SHALL achieve 100% success rate (11/11 POCs passing)
2. WHEN POC validation is complete THEN the system SHALL demonstrate that all core modules work in isolation
3. WHEN integration validation runs THEN the system SHALL confirm POC modules use identical code as production system
4. WHEN business rules are checked THEN the system SHALL verify POC completion prerequisite is met before production deployment

### Requirement 6: Error Resolution and Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all POC dependencies and configurations to be properly managed, so that POCs can run reliably in any environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN missing dependencies are identified THEN the system SHALL install all required packages and type definitions
2. WHEN TypeScript compilation errors occur THEN the system SHALL fix interface mismatches and API inconsistencies
3. WHEN browser API mocking is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive Jest mocks for Node.js testing
4. WHEN configuration issues arise THEN the system SHALL update tsconfig.json and package.json files appropriately
5. WHEN POC execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution steps
