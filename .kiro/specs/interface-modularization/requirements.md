# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification establishes universal business rules for modular interface architecture that must be followed in all software projects to ensure maintainable, scalable, and loosely coupled systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Explicit Dependency Declaration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to explicitly declare only the interfaces my module requires, so that dependencies are transparent and modules remain loosely coupled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing interfaces THEN modules SHALL use explicit import paths to specific interface files
2. WHEN examining module dependencies THEN the system SHALL show only interfaces actually required by that module
3. WHEN interfaces change THEN only modules with explicit imports SHALL be affected
4. WHEN adding interfaces THEN no central registry or export file SHALL require updates

### Requirement 2: Single Responsibility Interfaces

**User Story:** As a module maintainer, I want each interface to serve exactly one module's contract, so that changes remain isolated and modules can evolve independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining interfaces THEN each interface file SHALL contain contracts for exactly one module
2. WHEN module implementations change THEN other modules SHALL remain unaffected if interface contracts are preserved
3. WHEN designing interfaces THEN only minimal, essential methods SHALL be exposed
4. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN module relationships SHALL be unidirectional without circular references

### Requirement 3: Decentralized Interface Management

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want interfaces to be managed without central coordination, so that modules can be developed and maintained independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing interfaces THEN no central export hub or index file SHALL exist
2. WHEN adding modules THEN no central configuration SHALL require updates
3. WHEN importing interfaces THEN modules SHALL reference specific interface files directly
4. WHEN testing modules THEN each SHALL be testable in isolation without requiring unrelated interfaces

### Requirement 4: Transparent Module Relationships

**User Story:** As a developer, I want module dependencies to be immediately visible and understandable, so that system architecture is clear and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading module code THEN all interface dependencies SHALL be explicitly imported with full paths
2. WHEN tracing dependencies THEN the relationship between modules and interfaces SHALL be immediately apparent
3. WHEN documenting modules THEN interface contracts SHALL be clearly specified
4. WHEN analyzing architecture THEN separation of concerns SHALL be evident through minimal interface contracts

### Requirement 5: Build Optimization Support

**User Story:** As a build system, I want to include only the interface code actually used by modules, so that bundle sizes are optimized and unused code is eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building applications THEN only explicitly imported interface code SHALL be included
2. WHEN analyzing bundles THEN unused interfaces SHALL be excluded through tree-shaking
3. WHEN performing static analysis THEN actual interface usage SHALL be accurately determined
4. WHEN optimizing builds THEN dead code elimination SHALL work at the interface level

### Requirement 6: Predictable Change Impact

**User Story:** As a code reviewer, I want interface changes to have limited and predictable scope, so that modifications can be safely assessed and approved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interfaces are modified THEN only modules with explicit imports SHALL require changes
2. WHEN reviewing changes THEN affected modules SHALL be immediately identifiable
3. WHEN interfaces are added or removed THEN unrelated modules SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN performing impact analysis THEN change propagation SHALL be traceable and bounded
