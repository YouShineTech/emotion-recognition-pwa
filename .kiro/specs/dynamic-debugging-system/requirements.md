# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Emotion Recognition PWA project requires comprehensive dynamic debugging capabilities that allow developers to run each POC, production system components, and tests in a debugger with the ability to step through code line by line. This feature is essential for development, troubleshooting, and understanding the system's behavior at runtime.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to debug any POC in isolation, so that I can step through the code line by line to understand its behavior and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs a POC debug command THEN the system SHALL launch the POC with Node.js debugger attached
2. WHEN the debugger is attached THEN the system SHALL pause execution at the first line allowing step-through debugging
3. WHEN debugging a POC THEN the system SHALL provide source map support for TypeScript files
4. WHEN debugging a POC THEN the system SHALL allow setting breakpoints in VS Code or any Node.js compatible debugger
5. IF a POC has dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure all dependencies are available during debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to debug the production server components, so that I can troubleshoot issues in the main application modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs server debug mode THEN the system SHALL start the server with Node.js debugger attached
2. WHEN debugging the server THEN the system SHALL support hot reload with debugging capabilities maintained
3. WHEN debugging server modules THEN the system SHALL allow stepping through individual module code
4. WHEN debugging the server THEN the system SHALL provide access to all environment variables and configuration
5. IF the server uses clustering THEN the system SHALL provide options to debug individual worker processes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to debug client-side code in the browser, so that I can troubleshoot frontend issues and WebRTC connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs client debug mode THEN the system SHALL launch the client with browser debugging enabled
2. WHEN debugging the client THEN the system SHALL provide source maps for TypeScript debugging
3. WHEN debugging WebRTC connections THEN the system SHALL provide access to WebRTC internals and connection states
4. WHEN debugging the client THEN the system SHALL support both Chrome and Edge debugging
5. IF the client connects to a debug server THEN the system SHALL maintain debugging capabilities across the connection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to debug test suites, so that I can troubleshoot failing tests and understand test execution flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs test debug mode THEN the system SHALL execute tests with debugger attached
2. WHEN debugging tests THEN the system SHALL allow stepping through both test code and application code
3. WHEN debugging Jest tests THEN the system SHALL run tests in single-threaded mode for consistent debugging
4. WHEN debugging integration tests THEN the system SHALL provide access to all test fixtures and mocks
5. IF a test involves multiple components THEN the system SHALL allow debugging across component boundaries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unified debugging commands, so that I can easily access debugging capabilities without memorizing complex command structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer wants to debug any component THEN the system SHALL provide consistent npm script naming patterns
2. WHEN debugging commands are run THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about debugger attachment status
3. WHEN multiple debugging sessions are needed THEN the system SHALL handle port conflicts automatically
4. WHEN debugging is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clean shutdown procedures
5. IF debugging fails to start THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want VS Code integration for debugging, so that I can use a familiar IDE interface for debugging operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer opens the project in VS Code THEN the system SHALL provide pre-configured debug configurations
2. WHEN using VS Code debugging THEN the system SHALL support debugging POCs, server, client, and tests
3. WHEN debugging in VS Code THEN the system SHALL provide proper source mapping and breakpoint support
4. WHEN debugging multiple components THEN the system SHALL support compound debugging configurations
5. IF VS Code debugging is used THEN the system SHALL integrate with VS Code's terminal and output panels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want debugging documentation, so that I can understand how to use the debugging capabilities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs debugging help THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive debugging documentation
2. WHEN debugging issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guides for common problems
3. WHEN new debugging features are added THEN the system SHALL update documentation accordingly
4. WHEN debugging different components THEN the system SHALL provide component-specific debugging guides
5. IF debugging performance is poor THEN the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations
