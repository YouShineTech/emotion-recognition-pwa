# Integration Test Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution

Fixed integration test failures by implementing proper module mocking and dependency injection patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Mock Factory Implementation

- Created comprehensive mock factories for all external dependencies
- Implemented proper Jest mock patterns for browser APIs
- Added mock implementations for WebRTC, MediaDevices, and Canvas APIs

### 2. Test Environment Setup

- Configured Jest environment for both Node.js and browser-like testing
- Added proper TypeScript configuration for test files
- Implemented test utilities for common testing patterns

### 3. Module Interface Compliance

- Ensured all modules properly implement their defined interfaces
- Added proper error handling and validation
- Implemented consistent event emission patterns

### 4. Integration Test Structure

- Created proper test isolation between modules
- Implemented proper setup and teardown procedures
- Added comprehensive error scenario testing

## Test Results

All integration tests now pass with:

- ✅ Module interface compliance
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Event emission validation
- ✅ Mock dependency injection
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage

## Next Steps

Integration tests are now stable and can be used for continuous integration validation.
